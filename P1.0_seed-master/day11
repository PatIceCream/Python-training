NUMERICAL ANALYSIS

sign | exponent | maindisse

Vector space

+, X + X -> X
*, X*R -> X

finite dim: R^n
infinite dim: C^0[0,1]

F(x,d) = 0
d: data
x: solution

F(G(d),d) = 0 -> x = G(d), if solution is unique

1) for any d, there exists unique solution
2) F depends continuously on d

if 1) and 2), the problem F is stable

relative condition number of the problem

K = sup |delta x|*|d|/(|x|*|delta d|)

consistency of problem

F_n(x_n,d) = 0

F_n(x,d)->0, when n->inf, strong consistency

LAX-RICHT theorem

finite difference would be dangerous at high resolution
subtracting would be dangerous when two values are close
